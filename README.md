# Theodoro Fraga Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects and skills.

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, typically at http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment

The project can be deployed to various platforms:

1. **Vercel**: Import your GitHub repository for automatic deployment
2. **Netlify**: Connect to your GitHub repository or upload build files
3. **Firebase Hosting**: Use Firebase CLI to deploy
4. **Any Static Host**: Build your project with `npm run build` and upload the `dist` folder

See the DEPLOYMENT.md file for more detailed instructions.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized files in the `dist` directory that you can deploy to any static hosting service.
